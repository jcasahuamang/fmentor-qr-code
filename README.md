## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was the first time that i applied responsive concepts by using flex display on my own, not following a tutorial, and i could realize how a nested DIV element behaves when the parent DIV has a pre setup width and heigth.

And also, it is the first time I see this way to use css font-size property

```css
.qr-code-subtitle{
    font-size: clamp(5px, 5vw, 15px);    
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to deep into responsive design: media query, flexbox, css grid.
